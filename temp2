The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property however differs from individual objects in that it may be <a href="/wiki/Instantiation_principle" title="Instantiation principle">instantiated</a>, and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of <a href="/wiki/Class_(set_theory)" title="Class (set theory)">class</a> by not having any concept of <a href="/wiki/Extensionality" title="Extensionality">extensionality</a>, and from the philosophical concept of <a href="/wiki/Class_(philosophy)" title="Class (philosophy)">class</a> in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the <a href="/wiki/Problem_of_universals" title="Problem of universals">problem of universals</a>.

However, "laughter" is not an <i>essential</i> quality of the species <i>human</i>, whose Aristotelian definition of "rational animal" does not require laughter.

[01;31m[K<p>A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific.

[01;31m[K<p>In <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematical terminology</a>, a property <i>p</i> defined for all elements of a set <i>X</i> is usually defined as a function <i>p</i>: <i>X</i> â†’ {true, false}, that is true whenever the property holds; or equivalently, as the subset of <i>X</i> for which <i>p</i> holds; i.e. the set {<i>x</i>| <i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) = true}; <i>p</i> is its <a href="/wiki/Indicator_function" title="Indicator function">indicator function</a>.

[01;31m[K<p>The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a <a href="/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)" title="Predicate (grammar)">predicate</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Subject_(grammar)" title="Subject (grammar)">subject</a>. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as <a href="/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox" title="Russell's paradox">Russell's paradox</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Grelling%E2%80%93Nelson_paradox" title="Grellingâ€“Nelson paradox">Grellingâ€“Nelson paradox</a>. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous.

[01;31m[K<p>An <b>intrinsic</b> property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An <b>extrinsic</b> (or <b>relational</b>) property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. For example, <a href="/wiki/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> is a physical intrinsic property of any <a href="/wiki/Physical_body" title="Physical body">physical object</a>, whereas <a href="/wiki/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a> is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the <a href="/wiki/Respect" title="Respect">respective</a> object is placed.</p>[m[K
